# CC_ID
 A C# console program to validate credit card numbers.  If the card is valid, it can tell you who the issuer is
 (if it is from a major issuer like VISA.) Other issuers could easily be added just by knowing the issuer details.

This project currently runs in a console but the code could easily be adapted for use in a web application or similar.

This should easily build in modern versions of .Net or .Net Core with minimal changes.
