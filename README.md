 A C# console program to validate credit card numbers

This was a bit of a speed-coding challenge for me and a way to use the console to demo a real-world application of a few simple programming skills.  The calculations for this exercise require the use of the modulo operator in addition to a few different loop structures.  This project also demonstrates the parsing of strings into integers and notifies the user if the parse fails.

After validating a credit card number, if it is from one of the primary card issuers, the issuer's identity is revealed.

This should easily build in modern versions of .Net or .Net Core with minimal changes.
